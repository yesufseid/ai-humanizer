const  sample=`1. Introduction  

Brief description of sewerage and drainage systems  
Relevance to engineering environmental systems and pollution management  

Goals of this assignment  

🔍 2. Existing Sewer and Drainage System at AASTU  

Explain what kind of system pertains to the present sewer and drainage system (combined or separate system).  
Sketch or photograph the existing layout (add relevant observations or summaries of site visits).  

Types of sewers: sanitary, stormwater, combined  
Types of drainage: surface, sub-surface, storm water  

⚠️ 3. Root Cause Analysis of Problems  

Neglected upkeep or aging system?  
Obstructed or overflowing during precipitation?  
Inadequately designed or incorrectly pitched?   
Insufficiently inspected or monitored?  

Environmental considerations (e.g. negative odor, pollution of water bodies)  

📐 4. Design Proposal for a New System  

Classification of system: Separate or Combined  
Selection of materials and size of pipes  
Layout (plan view) of the system  
Manholes, catch basins, slope, and inspection points  
Self cleaning velocity of minimum 0.6 m/s  
Design flow to be determined from population, usage, and rainfall  
Provided rational method or Manning’s equation  
Drawings to be included (optional to sketch or use software)  

🛠 5. Maintenance and Inspection Plan  

Periodic cleaning  
CCTV monitoring  
Repair and replacement schedule  

🌱 6. Environmental and Health Benefits  

Less pollution  
Less incidence of flooding  
Higher standard of hygiene on campus  

📌 7. Conclusion and Suggestions
